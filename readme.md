By the end of this workshop, you'll know how to use these curation tools to advance your scholarly work.  

### What is Digital Curation? ###

# Both the process--Curation--and the person--Curator all share the Latin root "curare" meaning to "take care."  Traditionally, curators manage and interpret material objects whether that's art, books, buidlings, scientific tools, or more recently, born-digital data and objects.  They are content specialists who interpret collections of objects for and increasingly with the public.

# Digital: of, relating to, or being data in the form of especially binary digits##
# Digital Curation: the act of managing, storing, and interpreting a collection of objects (digitized or born digital) stored in digital formats and accessible over a network.##
